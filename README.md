# NewZone Standard

NewZone is a minimalistic, durable, and dependency-free standard for building autonomous digital systems.  
It defines a unified set of specifications covering identity, communication, routing, storage, trust, security, and long-term survivability.

This repository contains:

- core specifications (`/specs/`)
- documentation and templates (`/docs/`, `.github/`)
- standard structure and style guides
- versioning and changelog
- the complete index of all NewZone specifications

All documents follow strict minimalism, portability, and long-term stability principles.

## Goals

- Provide a civilization-scale digital standard
- Ensure autonomy and decentralization
- Maintain platform-agnostic design
- Guarantee deterministic and predictable behavior
- Preserve clarity and structural consistency across decades

## Structure

See `NZ_STANDARD_STRUCTURE.md` for the full repository layout.  
See `NZ_SPEC_INDEX.md` for the list of all specifications.

## Status

Draft v0 — active development phase.  
All specifications are subject to refinement until v1 stabilization.
